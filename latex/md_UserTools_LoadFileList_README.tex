\mbox{\hyperlink{classLoadFileList}{Load\+File\+List}} is a general way to specify the input files of Tool\+Chain. It can accept, in order of precedence\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily input\+File}, a single filename. This should include the filepath -\/ input\+Directory will NOT be prepended.
\item {\ttfamily file\+List}, a single filename of a text file containing a list of files to process. Each file should be on a new line. Lines beginning with {\ttfamily \#} will be ignored.
\item {\ttfamily file\+Pattern}, a pattern by which to match filenames. This may be a glob pattern or a regular expression. If this is to be used, input\+Directory {\itshape must} also be specified.
\item {\ttfamily input\+Directory}, the path to a directory to search for files matching the file\+Pattern.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Other configuration variables include\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily File\+List\+Name}, this tool will output a vector of strings of filepaths, which will be placed into the CStore. This variable specifies the name with which to retrieve that list. Default is {\ttfamily Input\+File\+List}.
\item {\ttfamily use\+Regex}, when using {\ttfamily file\+Pattern}, whether this represents a regex or a glob pattern.
\item {\ttfamily verbosity}, how verbose to be during execution.
