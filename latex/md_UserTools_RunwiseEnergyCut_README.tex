The Run\+Energy\+Cut Tool places a run-\/wise cut on the bsenergy. Cuts should be specified in the config file in the following way\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cut runmin runmax energymin energymax
\end{DoxyVerb}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The first word should be \textquotesingle{}cut\textquotesingle{} and identifies a cut line.
\item runmin and runmax specify the range of run numbers over which the cut is active.
\item energymin and energymax specify the range of energies to ACCEPT.
\end{DoxyItemize}

i.\+e. reject any event for which the following is true\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}(runmin <= run <= runmax) && NOT (energymin < bsenergy < energymax)
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Use a value of -\/1 to indicate a value of \textquotesingle{}any\textquotesingle{}. For example, to specify a cut which is active for any runs up to and including run 68670, that would reject any events with bsenergy less than 10MeV (but with no upper limit), use a line of\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cut -1 68670 10 -1
\end{DoxyVerb}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Any line in the config file matching this format will be added to the set of cuts applied.
\item Any number of cuts can be applied.
\item Any other configuration variables (.e.\+g verbosity) can also be included and will be used as normal.
