Pulls the total hits for the event from the {\ttfamily skq} common block. Note that the {\ttfamily skq} common block needs to be populated for this tool to work. Currently it does not search to find a populate {\ttfamily nhits} variable.

If the number of hits in the inner detector for the event is larger than a config variable {\ttfamily hit\+Limit} then the \char`\"{}\+Skip\char`\"{} variable is set in the datamodel so that the rest of the toolchain is skipped for this event.

The config variable {\ttfamily hit\+Limit} is set to 999 by default.\hypertarget{md_UserTools_IDHitsCut_README_autotoc_md30}{}\doxysection{Finalise}\label{md_UserTools_IDHitsCut_README_autotoc_md30}
