# This optional tool requires no configuration variables and allows the toolchain
# to be stopped at any time by sending the toolchain process the `SIGUSR1` signal.
# Stopping the toolchain in this way will set the toolchain `StopLoop` variable,
# resulting in ad-hoc termination of the toolchain whilst still calling the
# toolchain Finalise methods. Obtain the process ID from `ps -ux` and then do
# `kill -SIGUSR1 <process_id>`
