# identify AFT triggers
# previously this was used with WriteSkEvent Tool and would flag the AFT entry for writing,
# as well as setting the output tree based on whether the preceding event was a relic or muon candidate.
# Later the WriteSkEvent tool was replaced by the ReconstructMatchedMuons, as we buffer events while matching
# and then write them all out in a loop. Now all this Tool does is use the AFT trigger bits
# to set the CStore 'EventType' flag.

# apply software trigger to search for HE+OD events within 100ns, and flag such events as containing a muon
# for now this is only done when those bits aren't both set in the primary event, i.e. locating
# 'untagged' muons in other trigger types. For the moment this only records at most one muon per event.
